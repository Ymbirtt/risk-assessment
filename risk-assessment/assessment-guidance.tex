\section{Assessment Guidance}

The risk ratings of the risks in the previous section are calculated by multiplying $L$, the likelihood rating, by $S$, the severity rating.

\bigskip
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.5\linewidth}
\begin{tabular}[c]{lc}
  \toprule
  \textbf{Likelihood} & \textbf{Likelihood rating} \\
  \midrule
  Very unlikely & 1 \\
  Unlikely & 2 \\
  Likely & 3 \\
  Fairly likely & 4 \\
  Very likely & 5 \\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.5\linewidth}
\begin{tabular}[c]{lc}
  \toprule
  \textbf{Severity} & \textbf{Severity rating} \\
  \midrule
  First Aid injury/illness & 1 \\
  Minor injury/illness & 2 \\
  `3 day' injury/illness & 3 \\
  Major injury/illness & 4 \\
  Fatality/disabling injury & 5 \\

The following should be used to rate the risk and plan corrective action:

\newcommand{\riskinfo}[4]{
  #1 & #2 & #3 & #4 \\
}

\begin{tabular*}{\linewidth}[c]{cccp{33em}}
  \toprule
  \textbf{Risk Rating} & \textbf{Category} & \textbf{Tolerability} & \textbf{Comments} \\
  \midrule

  \riskinfo{1--2}{Very Low}{Acceptable}
  {No further action is necessary other than to ensure that the controls are maintained.}

  \riskinfo{3--4}{Low}{Acceptable}
  {No additional controls are required unless they can be implemented at very low cost (in terms of time, money and effort).}

  \riskinfo{5--7}{Medium}{Tolerable}
  {Consideration should be given as to whether the risks can be lowered, where applicable, to a tolerable level, and preferably acceptable level, but the costs of additional risk reduction measures should be taken into account.  The risk reduction measures should be implemented within a defined time period.}

  \riskinfo{8--14}{High}{Tolerable}
  {Substantial efforts should be made to reduce the risk.  Risk reduction measures should be implemented urgently within a defined time period and it might be necessary to consider suspending or restricting the activity, or to apply interim risk control measures, until this has been completed. Considerable resources might have to be allocated to additional control measures.}

  \riskinfo{15 and above}{Very High}{Unacceptable}
  {Substantial improvements in risk control are necessary, so that risk is reduced to a tolerable or acceptable level.}
